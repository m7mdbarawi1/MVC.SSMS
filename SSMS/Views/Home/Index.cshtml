        <h2>About SSMS</h2>
        <p>
            SSMS is developed using ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server. It enables educational institutions to centralize data management,
            automate repetitive tasks, and provide stakeholders with timely access to the information they need. With SSMS, administrators
            can streamline school workflows, teachers can manage coursework and assessments, and students can monitor their academic performance.
